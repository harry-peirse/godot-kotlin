# godot-kotlin
I use IntelliJ IDEA for working on this - you might want to do the same.

You can build using the gradle wrapper - just call `./gradlew clean build`

This will create a (I'm on windows) main.dll file somewhere in the build output directory.
The Godot resource files are already configured to point directly to this.
